**Your AI Co-Pilot for Science. Batteries Included.**

Nautilus Agent is a self-improving research assistant built on [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) by Nous Research. It automates the entire research lifecycle — from literature synthesis and protocol execution to data pipelines and reproducible analysis — so you can focus on discovery, not drudgery.

Use any model you want — [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (200+ models), [NovitaAI](https://novita.ai), [NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com), [Xiaomi MiMo](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com), [z.ai/GLM](https://z.ai), [Kimi/Moonshot](https://platform.moonshot.ai), [MiniMax](https://www.minimax.io), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), OpenAI, or your own endpoint. Switch with `nautilus model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

## Accelerate the whole research lifecycle

| Capability | What it does |
|------------|-------------|
| **🧬 Protocol Automation** | Turn experimental protocols into reproducible, version-controlled workflows. Run them step-by-step or fully autonomously. |
| **📚 Literature Synthesis** | Search arXiv, PubMed, and preprint servers. Extract key findings, compare studies, and generate annotated bibliographies. |
| **📊 Data Pipeline Builder** | Click-to-connect pipelines: cleaning, analysis, visualisation, and export — all version-controlled. |
| **🔬 Autonomous Research** | Describe your hypothesis and let Nautilus design experiments, run simulations, and iterate on results. |
| **🌡️ Instrument Integration** | Connect lab instruments, sensors, and APIs. Collect data automatically and feed it into your analysis pipelines. |
| **📋 Reproducibility by Design** | Every action is logged, versioned, and exportable as a standalone reproducibility package. |

## One line to the deep

### Linux, macOS, WSL2, Termux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tj-coding.github.io/nautilus-community/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell)

```powershell
iex (irm https://tj-coding.github.io/nautilus-community/install.ps1)
```

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
nautilus             # start your research assistant!
```

---

## Getting Started

```bash
nautilus              # Interactive CLI — start a conversation
nautilus model        # Choose your LLM provider and model
nautilus tools        # Configure which tools are enabled
nautilus config set   # Set individual config values
nautilus gateway      # Start the messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
nautilus setup        # Run the full setup wizard (configures everything at once)
nautilus update       # Update to the latest version
nautilus doctor       # Diagnose any issues
```

## How it works

1. **Describe your goal** — Tell Nautilus what you want to discover, build, or analyse in plain English.
2. **Plan & validate** — Nautilus generates a research plan with reproducible steps. Review and edit before execution.
3. **Run autonomously** — Nautilus executes protocols, runs analyses, fetches papers, and collects data while you focus on higher-level thinking.
4. **Ship the results** — Export notebooks, reproducibility packages, manuscripts, or shareable dashboards.

---

## Skip the API-key collection — Nous Portal

Nautilus works with whatever provider you want. But if you'd rather not collect five separate API keys for the model, web search, image generation, TTS, and a cloud browser, **[Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com)** covers all of them under one subscription:

- **300+ models** — pick any of them with `/model <name>`
- **Tool Gateway** — web search (Firecrawl), image generation (FAL), text-to-speech (OpenAI), cloud browser (Browser Use), all routed through your sub. No extra accounts.

One command from a fresh install:

```bash
nautilus setup --portal
```

---

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Nautilus has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `nautilus`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action                         | CLI                                           | Messaging platforms                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start chatting                 | `nautilus`                                    | Run `nautilus gateway setup` + `nautilus gateway start`, then send the bot a message |
| Start fresh conversation       | `/new` or `/reset`                            | `/new` or `/reset`                                                               |
| Change model                   | `/model [provider:model]`                     | `/model [provider:model]`                                                        |
| Set a personality              | `/personality [name]`                         | `/personality [name]`                                                            |
| Retry or undo the last turn    | `/retry`, `/undo`                             | `/retry`, `/undo`                                                                |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]`                                        |
| Browse skills                  | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>`                  | `/<skill-name>`                                                                  |
| Interrupt current work         | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message                | `/stop` or send a new message                                                    |
| Platform-specific status       | `/platforms`                                  | `/status`, `/sethome`                                                            |

## Acknowledgments — Built on Hermes Agent

Nautilus Agent is a **friendly fork** of [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) — the self-improving AI agent built by the incredible team at [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com). Hermes is one of the most capable and thoughtfully designed open-source agent frameworks available today, and Nautilus would not exist without it.

### What makes Hermes special

- **Built-in learning loop** — Agent-curated memory, autonomous skill creation, and skills that self-improve during use
- **Cross-session recall** — FTS5 session search with LLM summarization so your agent remembers what you talked about last week
- **Scheduled automations** — Built-in cron scheduler that runs unattended jobs and delivers results anywhere
- **Parallel subagents** — Spawn isolated subagents for parallel workstreams
- **Six terminal backends** — Local, Docker, SSH, Singularity, Modal, and Daytona
- **Unified gateway** — One process that serves Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Matrix, and more
- **200+ models** via OpenRouter, Nous Portal, and native providers

### Give Hermes some love ❤️

## Nautilus + Hermes = ⚚⚡

Nautilus takes everything that makes Hermes great and layers science-specific capabilities on top:

- **Protocol Automation** built on Hermes' skill and cron infrastructure
- **Literature Synthesis** powered by Hermes' web search and session memory
- **Data Pipelines** driven by Hermes' terminal and code execution tools
- **Reproducibility** enforced by Hermes' built-in versioning and audit trails

Every Nautilus feature is a Hermes feature, extended. When you use Nautilus, you're using Hermes — just with a snorkel and a lab coat.
